### Hello Rihal !
This is my first golang app experiment, The application expect xlsx format only. Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to make the CSV file as a downloadable. The program writes the converted file as a CSV to the console. However, there is a template file where you can upload the excel sheet.

 Almost all my time went into setting up go lang and fixing my double go lang installation with learning how modules work with syntax here and there.



### Running the application

```sh
docker-compose up
```
**localhost:8000** and you can see the application running.



### Learning curve.
If I get to do this again, I will use python/Flask with pandas and a two-line export method. Looking back at it, go lang has some different concepts than in node/python. However, I wanted to experience go lang and it's a very interesting language.
